# Future Roadmap

This document outlines the **future directions** of the OMANI Chatbot project, acknowledging current limitations and proposing solutions for scaling, safety, and usability.

---

## 1. Current Limitations

### a. Limited Omani Knowledge  
- **Challenge:** The current knowledge base includes WHO guidelines, CBT manuals, and limited local resources.  
- **Impact:** May not fully reflect Omani-specific cultural, religious, and social contexts.  

### b. Latency & Performance Issues  
- **Challenge:** End-to-end latency can be high due to Whisper STT, LLM processing, and retrieval delays.  
- **Impact:** Slower responses may reduce user trust, particularly during crisis interactions.  

### c. Scalability with ChromaDB  
- **Challenge:** Current vector store (ChromaDB) may not scale for enterprise-level usage.  
- **Impact:** Limits the system’s ability to handle large, multi-lingual, and multi-regional datasets.  

### d. Privacy Concerns  
- **Challenge:** Handling sensitive mental health conversations requires strict privacy guarantees.  
- **Impact:** Without advanced techniques, risk of data leaks or non-compliance with regulations.

## 2. Proposed Solutions

### a. Expanding Omani Knowledge  
- Partner with **clinical specialists in Oman** to curate domain-specific resources.  
- Add **locally relevant CBT material, cultural practices, and religious guidance**.  
- Build a **tiered knowledge base** (global → regional → Omani-specific).

### b. Latency Optimization  
- Backend: Model distillation, caching, and parallelized retrieval.  
- Frontend: Optimized Streamlit workflows and pre-fetching common queries.  
- Infrastructure: Deploy via **Docker + Kubernetes** with load balancing.

### c. Enterprise-Grade Vector Stores  
- Transition from **ChromaDB** to scalable solutions such as:  
  - **Pinecone (managed)** for enterprise reliability.  
  - **Weaviate or Milvus (open-source)** for privacy-preserving, on-premise deployment.  
- Enable **multi-region support** for cross-border healthcare projects.

### d. Privacy & Security Enhancements  
- Apply **end-to-end encryption** for transcripts and logs.  
- Incorporate **federated learning** and **differential privacy** for safer AI model updates.  
- Regular **security audits** to ensure compliance with international mental health data regulations.

## 3. Long-Term Roadmap

### Phase 1: Clinical Integration 
- Pilot with mental health professionals in Oman.  
- Collect feedback on cultural relevance, safety, and accuracy.  
- Improve crisis detection with **fine-tuned local datasets**.

### Phase 2: Technical Scaling
- Migrate to **enterprise vector databases**.  
- Optimize latency with **edge deployment** and **GPU acceleration**.  
- Expand language support (Arabic dialects, Swahili, Urdu).  

### Phase 3: Global Expansion 
- Position chatbot as a **global mental health assistant** with **localized cultural adaptations**.  
- Build APIs for integration with **telehealth platforms and NGOs**.  
- Establish partnerships with **universities and health ministries**.

## 4. Vision

The OMANI Chatbot aspires to become a **trustworthy, culturally sensitive, and scalable AI assistant** for mental health support.  
By addressing current limitations and implementing future improvements, it can provide **timely, empathetic, and safe interactions** for individuals in need—starting in Oman, and eventually expanding worldwide.
